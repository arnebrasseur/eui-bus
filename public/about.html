		<p>This was created to get easy access to bus information going to or from the EUI. ATAF has a realtime mobile interface but this shows no information when a bus has recently passed. There is also a mobile ATAF interface to get schedules but it is a bit clunky to use. At any rate, either site requires multiple clicks to access the information needed. This was created to make it possible to bookmark your favorite bus lines and access them directly. </p>
		<p>The information is scraped from the ATAF website and this script will likely stop working if ATAF redesigns their web presense. The code for the script is available <a href="https://github.com/kmlawson/eui-bus">on GitHub here</a> if anyone wants to make improvements or fix it should it stop working in the future.</p>
